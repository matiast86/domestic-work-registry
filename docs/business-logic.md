# ‚öôÔ∏è Business Logic Documentation

## üè† Overview

The **Domestic Work Registry** encapsulates domain-specific logic for managing domestic employment.  
Its core processes revolve around **contract lifecycle**, **attendance and job tracking**, and **payroll calculation**.

All business operations are implemented within the **Service Layer**, ensuring clear separation from controllers and repositories.  
Transactions are managed with `@Transactional` to maintain data consistency.

## üîÅ Contract Lifecycle

### 1) Contract Creation

**Actors:** Employer, Employee  
**Purpose:** Formalize the employment relationship.

**Flow**

1. Employer completes contract form.
2. `ContractService.createContract()`:
   - Validates employer & employee exist.
   - Ensures no active contract already exists.
   - Sets `active = true`.
   - Persists contract + schedule if provided.

**Validations**

- Employer/employee must exist and be active.
- Salary > 0.
- Start date ‚â§ end date.
- Employment type mandatory (`HOURLY` or `MONTHLY`).

Filters jobs by month/year, sorts chronologically, maps DTOs, and calculates totals.
